## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Next Button:**
   - Click the "Next" button (`next`) to navigate to the next image in the slideshow.

2. **Previous Button:**
   - Click the "Previous" button (`previous`) to go back to the previous image.

## 🎨 Customization

Feel free to customize the slideshow by adding or removing images in the `myImages` array in the JavaScript code.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The JavaScript code dynamically creates and appends `img` elements to the container, creating a fade-in effect when switching between images.
