This project is a minimalistic web page that displays coding languages and images in a horizontally scrolling manner. It utilizes CSS animations and masks to create a visually appealing effect.
I followed along Kelvin Powells tutorial and make some changes.

## Features

- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Smooth and customizable scrolling animations.
- Dark mode support using CSS color scheme.

## Animations

The project comes with a default scrolling animation. You can customize the speed and direction of the animation by adding specific data attributes to the HTML:

- `data-animated="true"`: Enables animation.
- `data-direction="right"`: Scrolls to the right.
- `data-direction="left"`: Scrolls to the left.
- `data-speed="slow"`: Slower scrolling speed.
- `data-speed="fast"`: Faster scrolling speed.

Example:

```html
<div class="scroller" data-animated="true" data-direction="right" data-speed="fast">
</div>
